# assignment-2

This is the second assignment of the semester for HES 505.

The second part of the course was designed to introduce basic operations with vector and raster data. These operations will form the basis for building the spatial databases that underlie the bulk of statistical analyses we'll conduct in this class and probably in your graduate research. This homework is designed to give you practice building your spatial workflow and using the various functions we've learned to maniputlate both vector and raster data. By the end of this assignment you should be able to:

* Use __predicates, measures, and transformations__ to clean, subset, and change vector data

* Alter the resolution, extent, and data values of rasters

* Build new datasets based on the relations between vector and raster data

We'll be using
